Face Mask Detection using CNN
This project is a Face Mask Detection System built using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model is designed to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

Model Architecture:
1) Convolutional layers
2) Pooling layers
3) Padding
4) Fully connected layers
These layers help the network learn important features from images and differentiate between the masked and unmasked faces.

Model Performance
The model shows strong performance on both training and testing datasets:
- Training Accuracy: 90%+
- Testing Accuracy: 90%+
This indicates that the model generalizes well and effectively identifies face mask usage.
